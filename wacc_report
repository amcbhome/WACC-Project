\section*{Introduction}
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) represents the average rate of return a company must pay to finance its assets. It reflects the cost of both equity and debt sources based on their relative proportions in the firm's capital structure. The WACC is a key metric for valuing investments, assessing financial performance, and supporting strategic decisions in corporate finance.

This report demonstrates a step-by-step calculation of WACC using five sources of finance: ordinary equity, preference shares, bank loans, debentures, and retained earnings.

\begin{tabular}{>{\raggedright}p{5.5cm} c}
\toprule
\textbf{Input Item} & \textbf{Value} \\
\midrule
Risk-free rate (Rf) & 3.00\% \\
Equity Beta ($\beta$) & 1.20 \\
Market return (Rm) & 8.00\% \\
Cost of preference shares & 6.50\% \\
Cost of bank loans (before tax) & 5.00\% \\
Cost of debentures (before tax) & 4.50\% \\
Corporate tax rate (T) & 20\% \\
Cost of retained earnings & 8.25\% \\
\midrule
Market value of equity & £6,000,000 \\
Market value of preference shares & £1,500,000\\
Market value of bank loans & £2,000,000 \\
Market value of debentures & £1,000,000 \\
Market value of retained earnings & £500,000 \\

\section{Step-by-Step WACC Calculations}
\subsection{1) Cost of Equity (CAPM)}
\[
K_e = R_f + \beta (R_m - R_f)
\]
\[
K_e = 0.03 + 1.2(0.08 - 0.03) = 0.09 = 9.00\%
\]

\subsection{2) Cost of Preference Shares}
\[
K_{ps} = 6.50\%
\]

\subsection{3) Cost of Bank Loans (after tax)}
\[
K_{d1} = 5.00\% (1 - 0.20) = 4.00\%
\]

\subsection{4) Cost of Debentures (after tax)}
\[
K_{d2} = 4.50\% (1 - 0.20) = 3.60\%
\]

\subsection{5) Cost of Retained Earnings}
\[
K_{re} = 8.25\%
\]

\section{Capital Structure Proportions}
\[
\text{Total Market Value} = 6{,}000{,}000 + 1{,}500{,}000 + 2{,}000{,}000 + 1{,}000{,}000 + 500{,}000 = 11{,}000{,}000
\]

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c}
\toprule
\textbf{Source} & \textbf{Weight (\%)} & \textbf{Cost (\%)} \\
\midrule
Ordinary Equity & 54.55\% & 9.00\% \\
Preference Shares & 13.64\% & 6.50\% \\
Bank Loans & 18.18\% & 4.00\% \\
Debentures & 9.09\% & 3.60\% \\
Retained Earnings & 4.55\% & 8.25\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{WACC Computation}

\[
\text{WACC} =
(0.5455 \times 0.09) + 
(0.1364 \times 0.065) +
(0.1818 \times 0.04) +
(0.0909 \times 0.036) +
(0.0455 \times 0.0825)
\]

\[
\text{WACC} = 4.91\%
\]

\section*{Conclusion}
The company has an estimated Weighted Average Cost of Capital of \textbf{4.91\%}. This figure can now be applied in investment appraisal decisions such as Net Present Value (NPV) and business valuation.
